VERSION 1.0

This is the version submitted to Dr. Manaris as a homework assignment to demonstrate 
knowledge of linked lists. I found the assignment interesting and have decided to 
further modify the code. Version 1.0 uses a somewhat flawed and unintutive menu system
that I plan on scrapping completely. I also plan on scrapping most of the methods in the
nested class.
